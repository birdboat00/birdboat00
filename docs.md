## Versioning
Versioning of releases uses semantic versioning 2.0.0 as specified at [semver.org](https://semver.org/).

Versioning of snapshots and development builds uses the following format:

```
22w21c
| | ||
| | ||-- revision letter for snapshot released in that week
| | |--- two-digit week of the year
| |----- letter w (for week)
|------- two-digit year
```
This example is third build ("**c**") released in the **21**st **w**eek of 20**22**.
If there are more than **a**-**z** releases in one week it continues with **aa**-**zz**.
